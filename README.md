SqJasmine
=========

A partial [Squirrel][1] port of [Jasmine][2] by [Simon Lundmark][3] written for behavior-driven development on the [Electric Imp][4] platform.

Its development is test-driven by basically copying and pasting the JavaScript code examples from the [Jasmine Documentation][5], translating them to Squirrel code (not much to change at all), running it then finally implementing enough of the Jasmine API until it runs without runtime errors :) Lots of fun!
